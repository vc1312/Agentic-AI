LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by large language models (LLMs).

## Useful Commands -
Setup Virtual Environment
- create virtual env : conda create --name myenv python=3.10
- activate venv : conda activate venv
- deactivate venv: conda deactivate

LangChain is a framework to help you build applications that use large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT — but in a smarter and more powerful way.

Think of it like a middleware for LLMs — it helps you connect models with tools, memory, documents, databases, and logic to build real apps.


# Why LangChain?
ChatGPT is great for answering prompts — but it:

- Doesn’t remember past chats in code
- Can’t access your data
- Can’t make decisions or call APIs

LangChain lets you build applications that solve all this:

- Add memory
- Use your documents or databases
- Call APIs
- Perform multi-step reasoning
- Build agents that act intelligently
